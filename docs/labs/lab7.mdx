# Lab 7 - Bowling

Build a text-based bowling game.

## Introduction

This lab is simple on the surface, but definitely annoying to implement. It'll be good for refining your logic & reasoning skills. That and you'll learn how to score bowling!

## Bowling

Here's how bowling is scored at a high level:

- A game consists of 10 frames
- Each frame consists of 2 rolls
- The 10th frame can have 3 rolls if the first 2 rolls are a strike or spare
- A strike is when you knock down all 10 pins with the **first** roll of a frame
- A spare is when you knock down all 10 pins with the **second** roll of a frame

Barring strikes & spares, a game's total score is the sum of the number of pins knocked down in each frame. The highest possible score is 300, consisting of 12 strikes.

Strikes & spares are a bit more complicated. A strike's value is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next 2 rolls. A spare's value is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next roll. If it's the 10th frame, then you will have 2 rolls to start. If you get a strike or spare, then you will have 1 more roll to finish the frame, making 3 rolls total. Otherwise it's just 2 rolls for the last frame.

## Program flow

Here's a rough outline of the program flow:

1. Player is prompted to enter their name
2. Player enters the number of pins knocked down in each roll for every frame. If the first roll of a frame is a strike, then the 2nd roll is not prompted for. Although you will still need to store the 2nd roll's value as 0, even though you won't be asking for the user to enter the 2nd roll. (_So notice we're storing our rolls in a vector or array_)
3. Once all frames have been entered, **evaluate** (don't print) the score for the player and store it. (_So we use a separate vector or array to store the scores_)
4. Repeat until the player enters `done` when prompted for their name
5. Print the scores for each player and the winner

Also note that the player can enter `done` at the beginning of the game, in which case no scores will be evaluated, and the print statement will be different.

## Algorithm

Algorithmically speaking, we can break this down into 2 parts:

#### 1. Scoring the game

- For each frame, we need to know the number of pins knocked down in each roll and tally it up according to the scoring rules
- If it's the last frame, its score is simply the sum of the number of pins knocked down in each roll, since there are no frames after for strikes/spares

#### 2. Scoring the frame

- If it's not a strike or spare, then the score is the sum of the number of pins knocked down in each roll
- If it's a strike, then the score is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next 2 rolls
- If it's a spare, then the score is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next roll

More specifically, scoring a frame is as follows:

#### For each frame

- Get the number of pins knocked down in each roll
- Determine if the frame was a strike or spare

If it was a strike, then get the current frame's score plus the next 2 rolls

If it was a spare, then get the current frame's score plus the next roll

Otherwise, just get the current frame's score

- Repeat until all frames are scored

#### TLDR

The _general_ formula for scoring a frame is:

```python
score += current_frame.roll1 + current_frame.roll2 # base case -- always do this
score += next_frame.roll1 + next_frame.roll2 # if strike
score += next_frame.roll1 # if spare
```

The caveats to consider are

1. You'll need to score the 10th frame slightly differently. It should be evaluated separately from the other frames.
2. If you get a strike two frames in a row, then you won't be able to do `score += next_frame.roll1 + next_frame.roll2`, because `roll2` in the next frame should be 0. You'll need to jump an extra frame ahead and get the next roll from there.
3. If you get a strike in the 9th frame as well as the 10th frame, then you'll need to make sure not to go a frame too far when scoring the 9th frame.

## Input/Output requirements

There are no special formatting requirements for this lab. Just output the words & lines as shown in the sample output.

As for the input requirements, just make sure your data types are what they should be. No error checking is required.

## Requirements

As per the lab's instructions, you'll need to implement the following:

- `vector` of `string`s to store the name(s) of the player(s)
- `vector` of 21 `int`s to store 2 rolls per frame, plus 1 roll for the 10th frame (if applicable)
- `vector` of `int`s to store the score(s) of the player(s)

- each player must enter their name and subsequently their score for each roll of each frame
- once the player has quit the game (by entering `done` when prompted for their name), then the game should be scored and the results should be printed

## Testing

:::info For Windows Users

If you're using Windows, the testing used here will not work. So unless you have [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) installed, you'll need to do the testing on the lab machines or on MacOS/Linux.

:::

#### installing curl & make on Ubuntu

```
sudo apt install curl make
```

---

### Makefile

If you wish to test your program without inputting the values yourself, I've provided a `Makefile` that will both compile and test the program using the inputs from the outputs [here](#example-output-1) and [here](#example-output-2) based on the commands below.

:::caution READ BEFORE PROCEEDING

The Makefile assumes your source file is named `bowling.cpp`. If it's not then change it to that if you wish to test with the Makefile. Also make sure to run the following commands in the same directory as your `bowling.cpp`.

:::

#### Download Makefile

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan0429/cs102-writeups/main/lab7/Makefile --output Makefile
```

#### Compile (compiles your program)

```bash
make
```

#### Running the tests

:::caution Read before running the tests

Make sure you've at least completed the gameplay loop of the program before running the tests. Basically, don't test until you have everything and just want to make sure the scoring works. Also, the following tests omit the input from the output. So the Canvas output will show the inputs printed along with the outputs, whereas the test outputs will not show those inputs (the pins knocked in each roll). This is just a result of the test(s), and does not reflect your program's full output in that sense.

:::

#### tests the 1st input from [output 1](#example-output-1)

```bash
make test1
```

#### tests the 2nd input from [output 2](#example-output-2)

```bash
make test2
```

You'll want to test for a bunch of input types as well, since the two provided on Canvas won't cover every case. The following command will test 5 player inputs, each of which will have random rolls each frame. You can view the inputs from the `test.txt` file that is generated once the command is run. I can't provide a solution output, so you'll have to check your scores yourself. You can do it manually, or I recommend using [this bowling score calculator](#bowling-score-calculator) to check your scores.

#### tests for random inputs (**assumes you have python3 installed**)

```bash
make random
```

:::note

You don't need to run `make` to compile before testing. `make test1`, `make test2`, and `make random` will compile the program for you as well as run the tests.

:::

Lastly, I'll mention that if either of the `make` tests don't print anything out, it's likely because you're handling the incorrect amount of rolls/frames or your output doesn't match the format from the example shown earlier.
