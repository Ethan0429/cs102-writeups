# Scope

The concept of isolation of certain contexts.

## Summary

**Scope** refers to the context in which certain actions are performed.

Functions have their own scope, and variables defined within a function are only accessible within that function.

If statements and loops also have their own scope, and variables defined within them are only accessible within that scope.

## Usage/Syntax

Scopes typically denoted by curly braces `{}`. Anything that occurs within the curly braces is considered to be within the scope of that statement.

### Example

```cpp showLineNumbers
int main() { // main scope
    int x = 5;      // x is defined within the scope of main()
    if (x == 5) {   // start of if statement scope
        int y = 10; // y is defined within the scope of the if statement

        x = 10;
    } // end of if statement scope

    // y is not accessible here since it was **defined** within the if statement
    // This will error
    std::cout << y;
} // end of main scope
```

In the above example, the red-highlighted line will crash the program because `y` is not accessible outside of the scope of the if statement. As far as `main()` is concerned, `y` does not exist.

Notice that `x` is accessible inside _and_ outside of the if statement scope. This is because `x` was defined within the scope of `main()`. Scopes will have a hierarchy, and variables defined within a scope will be accessible to any scope that is within that scope.
