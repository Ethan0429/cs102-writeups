# Function

An isolated block of code that performs a specific task.

## Summary

Functions are never required to be used, but they are useful for isolating code for organization and re-usability.

Functions are <LinkWithIcon to="/docs/references/general/scope" text="scoped" />, meaning anything defined inside the function is only accessible inside the function

Typically, a function will compute a value and **return** it to the **caller**.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="caller"
  values={[
    { label: 'Caller', value: 'caller', },
    { label: 'Return', value: 'return', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="caller">

:::info Caller

The caller is the code that calls the function. The caller is responsible for passing the parameters to the function and handling the return value.

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="return">

:::info Return

To return a value is just what it sounds like: to give a value back to the caller. The value is given back using the `return` keyword. `return 1` for example, will return the integer `1` to the caller.

## Usage/Syntax

Functions can be written in many ways, but for the purposes of this course they will follow a particular syntax.

### General syntax

```cpp
<return type> <name>(<parameters>) {
    <body>
}
```

| Return type                                                             | Name                                                                                                             | Parameters                                                                                | Body                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| The type of the value returned by the function, e.g. `int`, `char`, etc | The name of the function. Can be anything you want, so long as it does not conflict with existing function names | A list of variable(s) that you **pass** to the function to be used in the body (optional) | The code to be executed when the function is called |

### Examples

```cpp
// defining a function that returns an int
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// calling the function
int sum = add(1, 2); // sum = 3

// defining a function that returns a char
char get_first_letter(std::string str) {
    return str[0];
}

// calling the function
char first_letter = get_first_letter("Hello, world!"); // first_letter = 'H'
```

### Return type

Return types can be any valid C++ type. One special type is `void`, which means that the function does not return a value. These are used for functions that modify a variable or perform an action, but do not need to return anything.

#### Example

```cpp
// defining a function that does not return a value
void print(std::string str) {
    std::cout << str << std::endl;
}

// calling the function
print("Hello, world!"); // prints "Hello, world!" to the console
```

In the above example, `print()` does not return anything since all it does is print text to the screen, so we use `void` as the return type.

### Parameters/Arguments

Parameters are variables that you pass to the function to be used in the body. If you want to perform a specific task but need more information to do so, then you can pass that information to the function as a parameter.

Functions don't need parameters, but they can have as many as you want.

Parameters are separated by commas, and are written in the following format:

```cpp
<type> <name>
```

#### Example

```cpp
// no parameters
void print_hello() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
}

// one parameter of type string and name str
void print(std::string str) {
    std::cout << str << std::endl;
}

// two parameters of type int and name a and b
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

When passing parameters to a function, the types must match the types of the parameters in the function definition, and the order must match as well. The values being passed can be variables, literals, or expressions.

:::info Literal

If you didn't know, a literal is a value that is written directly into the code. For example, `1` is a literal integer, `"Hello, world!"` is a literal string, and `true` is a literal boolean. They have no variable name, and are not stored in memory.

:::

## `main()`

The `main()` function is a special function that is automatically called when the program is run. It is the entry point of the program, and is where the program starts executing.

The `main()` function is always defined in the global scope, and is always of type `int`.

### Parameters

The `main()` function takes two optional parameters:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    // ...
}
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                                                                  |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `argc`    | `int`    | The number of arguments passed to the program                                |
| `argv`    | `char**` | An array of strings containing the arguments passed to the program (C-Style) |

#### Example

```bash
./my_program hello world
```

If we had a program called `my_program` that took two arguments, then `argc` would be `3` and `argv` would be `["./my_program", "hello", "world"]`.

In other words, once the program enters main, the `argc` variable will be set to the number of arguments passed to the program + 1 (because we include the name of the program as well), and the `argv` variable will be set to an array of strings containing the arguments passed to the program (including the name of the program at `argv[0]`).
