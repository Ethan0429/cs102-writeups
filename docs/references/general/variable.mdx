# Variable

Labels used for identifying certain types of data.

## Summary

A variable is a named location in memory used to store data values. A variable can be used to store a single value or a collection of values. A variable is created when you assign a value to it using the assignment operator `=`. The variable name is on the left side of the operator and the value to be stored in the variable is on the right side of the operator.

### Terminology

| Define/Initialize                                | Declare                                                 | Assign                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| To create a variable _and_ assign a value to it. | To create a variable _without_ assigning a value to it. | To assign a value to a variable that has already been created. |

## Usage/Syntax

A variable is made up of three parts:

1. The data type of the variable
2. The name of the variable
3. The value of the variable

#### Example

```cpp
<type> <name> = <value>;
```

### Declaration

```cpp
int x; // Declare a variable named x of type int
```

### Assignment

```cpp
x = 5; // Assign the value 5 to the variable x
```

### Define/Initialize

```cpp
int x = 5; // Declare a variable named x of type int and assign the value 5 to it
```

### Operators

All C++ primitive data types support the following assignment operators:

| Operator | Description    | Example  |
| -------- | -------------- | -------- |
| `=`      | Assignment     | `x = 5`  |
| `+=`     | Addition       | `x += 5` |
| `-=`     | Subtraction    | `x -= 5` |
| `*=`     | Multiplication | `x *= 5` |
| `/=`     | Division       | `x /= 5` |
| `%=`     | Modulus        | `x %= 5` |
| `++`     | Increment      | `x++`    |
| `--`     | Decrement      | `x--`    |

These operators can be used to perform operations on the value of a variable and subsequently assign the result to the variable.

#### Example

```cpp
int x = 5;
x += 5; // x is now 10
```

Another way to write this is:

```cpp
int x = 5;
x = x + 5; // x is now 10
```

But it's more convenient to use the assignment operators.

### Don't do this

```cpp
int x = 5;
x + 5; // x is still 5
```

In the above example, the value of `x` is not changed because the assignment operator `=` is not used. We add `5` to `x` but we don't assign the result to `x`, so we essentially do nothing.

### Naming Conventions

There are two things to consider when creating a variable:

1. The name of the variable should be descriptive.
2. The name of the variable should **consistently** follow _some_ naming convention.

:::info Naming Conventions

A naming convention is a set of rules for naming variables, functions, classes, etc. The purpose of a naming convention is to make code more readable and consistent. It really doesn't matter which naming convention you use, **as long as you use it consistently.**

#### Common Naming Conventions

| Convention  | Description                                                             | Example   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Camel Case  | The first letter of each word is capitalized except for the first word. | `myName`  |
| Snake Case  | Each word is separated by an underscore and all letters are lowercase.  | `my_name` |
| Pascal Case | The first letter of each word is capitalized including the first word.  | `MyName`  |

#### Example

```cpp
int x = 5; // Mostly bad

int numberOfStudents = 5; // good
```

In the above example, the first variable name is not descriptive. It's not clear what `x` is supposed to represent. The second variable name is descriptive. It's clear that `numberOfStudents` is supposed to represent the number of students in a class.

Sometimes it's appropriate to use arbitary names for variables. For example, when using a loop counter:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // Do something
}
```

In the above example, `i` is a loop counter. It's not important what `i` is called, as long as it's consistent. It's common to use `i` as a loop counter, but you could use any name you want.
